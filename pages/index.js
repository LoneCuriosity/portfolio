Information to be collected includes but is not limited to velocity, altitude, temperature, acceleration, location, pressure, etc. The system should have a live data streaming component to it as well.</p>
            <p className="text-white">Solution: TAS(Telemetry Acquisition System) was created to address most of not of the requirements that were required. Some of the components used within TAS include BME280, BMI088, LoRa Module, PA1616 GPS module, PCF2385, and SD module. The combination of these systems forms TAS. Using the LoRa module TAS can stream live data packets as far as 15 km. TAS also takes advantage of its GPS capabilities to track its location during and after the flight to better allow our recovery team to pinpoint the location of the rocket during recovery operations.</p>

          <p className="text-white px-[25%] text-center">I was born and grew up in the Rio Grande Valley. As a young child, I was always fascinated by how things worked. My grandmother would tell me a story about how when I was young I would stand by the window for hours watching as machines built my neighborhood around me. Growing up I dont think I ever lost this wonder but rather found a way to channel it. I love to tinker with stuff, build stuff and yes break stuff. I think this quote from Henry Petroski puts it best.</p>
