## Lessons Learned

Throughout my learning process, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of Next.js and Tailwind, with a particular focus on the optimization advantages that Next.js offers and the rapid iteration capabilities provided by Tailwind.


## Optimizations

An advantageous feature of employing Next.js lies in its comprehensive optimization capabilities. Notably, the utilization of its Image component enables us to enhance the handling of images under low bandwidth conditions. While there are numerous additional optimization measures at play, elaborating upon all of them would be a time-intensive endeavor.
